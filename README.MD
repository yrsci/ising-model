The simulation is run using ising-model.sh, which prompts the user to either accept default values for the temperature & applied field or input their own. They are also prompted to enter a lattice side length and a directory name, where the files generated by the simulation will be saved (with a suffix taken from the current time, to prevent accidental overwriting). These variables are then passed to the simulation script ising-model.py. The simulation saves regular snapshots as .pbm files and also generates .gif animations from these files for review.

Once the run completes, the user has the option of proceeding straight to the analysis (via automated running of analysis.sh, which again prompts the user for values and runs a python script lattice_analysis.py), or exiting the program. As the simulation saves regular .pbm snapshots of the run at each temperature / field value, it is easy to run analysis.sh at a later time to analyse the data.

The plots for the h=0 case are split into their own script to keep lattice_analysis.py easily readable.
